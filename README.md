# Biddershop 


![image](./images/projectImage.png)

This is my Semester Project 2 submission, an online auction marketplace called **Biddershop**. It allows users to browse, bid, and sell things while maintaining a simple, user-friendly interface. Upon registering, users are given 1000 credits to start bidding on the platform.

## Features:

- Unregistered users can search and view all listings.
- Registered users can log in or log out, and update their profile avatar.
- Registered users can create a listing with title, deadline, gallery, and description.
- Users can bid on listings created by others.
- All users can view the bids made on any active listing.
- Listings with expired deadlines are automatically marked as "ended."



## Project Planning:

- I used Trello to track tasks and progress.
- A Notion Gantt chart was used to manage the timeline and ensure the project stayed on track.

## Design:

- Design and prototypes were created in Figma.
- The design focuses on ease of use and clear navigation.

## Reflections:

During development, I faced challenges, particularly with implementing infinite scrolling to load more listings as users scroll. This required multiple fixes, and I learned valuable lessons about structuring infinite scroll implementations for future projects. 

Iâ€™m happy with the outcome of **Biddershop** and am fully aware of areas for improvement, such as setting up a more structured error system next time. I appreciate the learning experience and am excited to apply this knowledge to future projects.
